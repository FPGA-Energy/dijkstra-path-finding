Implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm in Software and Hardware 


Dijkstra2.c repeats evaluating a route from index 0 to index n-1 in a graph

It prints out a number (added wight of the route after 500000 iterations
Measured on an ordinary pc (compiled with -O3) it takes 3,5 second corresponding to 6800 ns for a route
